# Flappy_Edge

Yo Buddys , just finished my " Flappy_Edge " browser extension . This is an extension of flappy bird game but better than normal one , as it's just the game we played so many times in our life , i didn't made a playable version for example . This was very frustrating for me , each time i was getting an error , sometimes no display or popup , etc so I rewrote the full code with comments for the last time and it took complete 12 Hours to build this sht , atlast This was worthed . This includes a user specific leaderboard , great sound effects , bird with fall and rise physics ( animated ) and a start and lose screen , further i'll bring difficulty updates and more birds and backgrounds , a universal leaderboard and much more as i get to know abt what i can add , i'll do so . 

I created this to overcome the boredom of using browser for a long time , this is better as its smooth , well performance optimized and simple ui and controls . 

### TOTAL TIME SPENT - 7  + 5.5 = 12.7 Hours Hours [ I updated after submission ]

> 7 hours Code + 5 Hours Code
> 45 mins repo and testing
